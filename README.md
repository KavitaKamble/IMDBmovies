IMDB Movies Data Analysis
Introduction
In this project, we will be analysing the movies data over the years 2008 to 2017. We will be using tmdb-movies.csv file as our input data that we will be working on for our analysis. This data set provides the data related to movies in terms of their budget, revenue, runtime, ratings, etc.

Some of the question that we will try to get answers for are:

Is there a correlatin between movie budgets and revenue?
Is there a correlation between movie runtimes and revenue?
Is there a correlation between movie popularity and revenue?
Who are the top directors in terms of nuber of movies they made?
Is there a correlation between average revenue and directors?
Did all the movies made by a top director grossed higher revenue?
Is there a correlation between movie release year and revenue?
